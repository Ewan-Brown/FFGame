Ewan's RPG Game project

Do whatever the heck you want with this, in fact i'd be amazed if you found a use for the software here.

A boring java game made by Ewan Brown with little to no user input, the game pretty much plays itself.
Made for reasons of obtaining more knawledge

The game is essentially comprised of a player and of monsters. The player enters fights with the monsters one at a time, with turn based attacks. The monster may spawn with a weapon, which may have special attributes. With each attack there is a chance the attacker will miss. The fights entirely play themselves out as the player watches. As the player kills more. Onsters, he obtains XP and can level up, increasing his base stats. The monsters also get increasingly stronger. Eventually the player reaches a certain 'stage' and a boss is spawned with very high stats. If the player kills it he wins! Yay! But if the player dies, its game over and restarts. The only input the player has is a start screen with:
Playername
Difficulty(monster stat multipler)
Fastmode(little or no pauses in fights)
Sleep time (how fast the game plays out, higher is slower)

There is also a dylan drive mode with a really big button....... You know you want to press it.
