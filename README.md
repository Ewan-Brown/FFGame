# FFGame 

This is a Game created by Ewan Brown for fun and practising Java
There is minimal user input, being only difficulty level and player name and is only text-output

In this game the 'player' fights against an endless mob of monsters, picking up weapons do improve damage, and collecting XP
to level up and gold, only to be lead to his inevitable death.

I intend to add a RPG-Style Level up system, with eventual Bosses, a shop where the user can choose items and fighting with
allies/pets against multiple enemies simultaneously. I also want to add a 'story log' where your player's story will be saved
in a format that looks like a story! although that will most likely come after everything else

This game pretty much uses all the basics of RPGs (Levels,Bosses,Turn Based attacks, etc) and will hopefully have FTL-style 
random events.
